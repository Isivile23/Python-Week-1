# Project Planning
## Planning Tools

### User stories

* User stories are brief, simple, and informal, perfect for jotting down on index cards.
* They typically follow the format "As a [user/role], I want [goal] so that [reason/benefit]".

### Use cases

* Use case include a title, an actor (a user or system), and a scenario that describe how a goal is achieved.
* User stories and use cases may seem similar, they capture different information.
* User stories focus on the who, what, and why of a task or goal, while use cases cover the who, what, and how of achieving that goal.
