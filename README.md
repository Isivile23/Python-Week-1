# Python-Week-1
# Python Introduction: Basics of Python

Python is a programming language used by many large organization such as Google, Yahoo and IBM.
Jupyter Notebook is a web application where you write and execute python programs. 
"#" is a comment symbol.

# Variables and types

Variables contain lowercases, uppercases and underscore. In Python variable names begin with a lowercase.
We have different types of variable: String, float, Boolean, Complex and integer.
Data structure stores a list of values in a variable.
Sets are declared in curly braces.
Tuples are similar to list but they cannot be modified once declared.They are useful when you need to store large amount of data in memory.
Dictionary is a collection of key value pairs.
Dictionaries are declared using curly braces and accessed using keys.

# Operators 

Operators are instructions that perform operations on variables and values in python.
The most familiar type of operator is the arithmetic operator.It is used for mathematical calculations.
Examples of arithmetic operators are:
Addition operator
Multiplication operator
Exponent operator
Division 
Modulus Operator

Another set of operators in Python are comparison operators, logical operators, identity operators and membership operators.

Comparison Operators evaluate two variables or values and produces a Boolean result, either true or false.
Logical Operators, such as "and", "or" and "not" operate on Boolean values.
Membership operators "in" and "not" are used to check whether a value is present in a sequence or not.

# Control Flow

if statement is one of the control flow in progarmming. It allows you to execute a code only if the statement or condition is true.
You can add more code under the if statement by indenting it further.
If you add an else statement the code under that will be executed if the condition is false.
In Python use the if statement like "a=True, if a: print it is true"
For loop can be used to iterate over a list.
In While Loop we can execute a set of statements as long as the condition is true.

# Functions

A function is a block of code which only runs when it is called.
You can pass data, known as parameters into a function.
A function can return data as a result.
Functions can be defined using the "def" keyword followed by the function name and argument in parameters.
The keyord "None" represent the absence of value, and it is the default return value for functions that do not explicitly return anything.

# Classes and objects

Class helps to label and organize related collection of functions and attributes.
We use an uppercase letter for class name.

# Python Operators

Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.

Python divides operators in the following groups:

* Arithmetic Operators
* Assignment Operators
* Comparison Operators
* Logical Operators
* Identity Operators
* Membership Operators
* Bitwise Operators

Arithmetic Operators

Arithmetic operators are used with numeric values to perform common mathematical operations.
* Addition (+)
* Subtraction (-)
* Multplication (*)
* Division (/)
* Modulus (%)
* Exponentiation (**)
* Floor division (//)

Assignment Operators

Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables.

* =               
* +=
* -=
* /=
* %=
* //=
* **=
* &=
* |=
* ^=
* <<=

Comparison operators

Comparison Operators are used to compare two values.

* Equal (==)
* Not equal (!=)
* Greater than >
* Less than <
* Greater than or equal to >=
* Less than or equal <=

Logical operators

Logical operators are used to combine conditional statements.

* "and" Returns a True if both True
* "or" Returns a True if one is True
* "not" Reverse the result, returns False if the result is True

Identity operator

Identit operators are used to compare the objects, not if they are equal, but if they are actually the same object, with the same memory location.

* "is" Returns True if both variable are the same object.
* "is not" Returns True if both variables are not the same object.
